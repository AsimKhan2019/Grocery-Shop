### The Grocery Store
A console application for adding items to a grocery list, with quantity, measurement, price and a subtotal based on quantity times price. The grocery list is saved to a file located in the current directory of where the application is ran. The file name is `myGroceryList.txt`
I intentionally made methods for each action of the console-app. Typically this makes an application easier to read and test when broken into small pieces. 
Each method is responsible for one thing. 

#### Features
